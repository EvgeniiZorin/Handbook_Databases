    "## Partitioning\n",
    "\n",
    "> Basically splitting a table into smaller tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Partitioning is dividing a table into smaller tables based on a single column (date or integer).\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- A table containing sales data could be partitioned by month using the column containing the sale date, or by geographic region using the state/province code;\n",
    "- It is a good pratice to partition by date\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of partitioning:\n",
    "- Horizontal: assigning rows to different partitions;\n",
    "- Vertical: assigning sets of columns to different partitions (must be done manually);\n",
    "\n",
    "When partitioning a table horizontally, you must choose a **partition key** - a column whose values are used to assign a row to a particular partition. \n",
    "\n",
    "Partitioning methods:\n",
    "- Range partitioning: \n",
    "  - break up tables by date ranges;\n",
    "  - Allows for a maxvalue partition to catch any rows that don't map to any other partition\n",
    "- List: \n",
    "  - allows you to specify which values will be assigned to each partition\n",
    "  - Can be used with enumerated set of values, e.g. state codes (CA, TX, VA), currencies (USD, EUR, JPY)\n",
    "  - doesn't provide for a spillover partition (to catch any rows that don't map to any other partition)\n",
    "  - the column chosen as the partitioning key should contain only a small number of values\n",
    "- Hash partitioning:\n",
    "  - tries to distribute rows evenly across a set of partitions by applying a hashing function to the column value \n",
    "  - Hash partitioning works best when the partitioning key column contains a large number of distinct values\n",
    "- Composite partitioning: \n",
    "  - Allows you to use two different types of partitioning for the same table\n",
    "\n",
    "Check partitions - MySQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    partition_name,\n",
    "    partition_expression,\n",
    "    partition_description\n",
    "FROM information_schema.partitions\n",
    "WHERE table_name = 'sales'\n",
    "ORDER BY partition_ordinal_position;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits:\n",
    "- Partition pruning: You may only need to interact with as few as one partition instead of the entire table; \n",
    "- Partition-wise joins: if you execute a query that includes a join to a partitioned table and the query includes a condition on the partitioning column, the server can exclude any partitions that do not contain data pertinent to the query;\n",
    "- An ability to delete data that is no longer needed, e.g. deleting a partition that is older than seven years old; \n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "- There is a hard number of partitions - A table cannot be partitioned into an infinite number of partitions"

    "- Improves performance of some queries with filter and aggregate clauses\n",
    "- Better done when cardinality of values in a column or group of columns is large"
